        <p1>I am going to show two paragraphs that each have a different font. However, I have no idea what should I write in this two paragraph. So this will be my first paragraph.</p1>
        <style>  
        p1 {font-size: 20px;}
        </style>
        <p2>Here is the second paragraph. Again, I don't know what to write. And since I am a lazy guy that do not want to type too many words, my second paragraph will be in end here.</p2>
        <style>
        p2 {font-size: 40px;}
